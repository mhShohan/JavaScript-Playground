// Algorithms => Algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem


/**
 * Complexity
 *      => Time Complexity === Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm.
 *      => Space Complexity === Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity.
